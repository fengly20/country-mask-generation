README

This folder contains the input world country boundary shapefile for CEDS country mask generation. 

The shapefile is manually created mainly based on GPW v3 ntblnds.shp with a small portion mixed using gdam v2.8 country boundary shapefile to provide boundary information of some newly assembled/dissolved countries/regions. 

The complete country list can be found in country_list_and_notes.xlsx.
